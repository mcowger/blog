<p>If you go to EMCworld this year - do NOT miss Area 52 Monday Afternoon (4:30PM) in Hall A.</p>
<p>Hosted by Chad Sakac, there's a ton of awesome demos in here, including wildly unsupported but cool stuff from Isilon CTO Nick Kirsch, CTO Office Jonas Rosland, and maybe even something I cooked up.</p>
<p>Don't miss it.</p>
