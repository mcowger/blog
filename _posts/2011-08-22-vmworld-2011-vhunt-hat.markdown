<p>Alrighty then.  <a href="http://vtexan.com/2011/08/22/the-great-scavenger-vhunt-at-vmworld/">Tommy posted his VMworld 2011 vHunt hat</a>, so I guess its time to post mine too.</p>
<p>I love racing.  I will happily race anything that can be raced.  Cars, mountain bikes, RC cards, bumper boats.  I've raced them all.  I have a special love for Formula One racing - in my opinion the pinnacle of all motor spots.</p>
<p>So, in keeping with that theme and the vSpecialist team's addiction to energy drinks, I present to you my vHunt hat:</p>
