<p>Is everyone ready &amp; excited for VMworld? I am!</p>
<p>Some of my fellow vSpecialist twitter aficionados are doing a bit of a contest this year - we're calling it the <strong>vhunt</strong>. Think of it as a Twitter based scavenger hunt.</p>
<p>Here's the rules/plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Myself and a few others on the vSpecialist team (and I hear now that VCE as well) will be tweeting various tasks or challenges throughout VMworld. Day and Night, on the floor, in the labs, in the sessions, at the parties, etc. For everything thats vhunt related, we'll be tagging it with the <strong>#vhunt</strong> hashtag. The tasks/challenges will be wide ranging. Everything from easy stuff like 'tweet a photo of you and any vSpecialist' to 'get all 3 EMC VCDX's together and tweet something they all disagree on' to 'tweet your favorite @lynxbat hack and why'.</li>
<li>Every time you repond, tag it with <strong>#vhunt</strong>, and the marketing people will be watching :)</li>
<li>Everyday, 3 times a day, the EMC marketing peeps will be watching and calculating participation. Winners get cool stuff like iPads, Playstation 3's, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Its that simple!</p>
