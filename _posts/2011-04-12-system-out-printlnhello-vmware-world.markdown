<p>I've always wondered if I should start a blog.  On one hand, it has always seemed a little odd to have something online that you expect that people might read.  Maybe a little self-serving, even.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I've also got ideas and thoughts that I think are worth sharing and discussing for which I don't have an alternate forum.  Some of the <a href="http://nickapedia.com">most important things</a> in my corner of the industry get announced or <a href="http://virtuallyghetto.com">discussed on a blog</a> somewhere.  I figure it might also improve my writing.</p>
<p>So, I think I'll give this a shot - what's one more blog to read if you've got a <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">good RSS reader</a> anyways.</p>
<p>What is it that I'd like to talk about?  Well, mostly things that i know about.  I be talking about VMware, virtualization more generally, high end storage engineering, automation/mass deployment - those sorts of things.</p>
<p>If you care, my background is mostly in Unix/Linux deployments, VMware and storage engineering.  I've come from startups doing large web farms handling 100M+ hits/day to working for Technical Operations at <a href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce.com</a> and most recently at <a href="http://www.3par.com">3PAR</a> (now <a href="http://www.hp.com">Hewlett Packard</a>, of course).</p>
