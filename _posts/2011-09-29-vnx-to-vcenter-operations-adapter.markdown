    Hi

    excellent scripts and idea. Can you confirm what version of VCOPS you are using please. The enterprise product or the virtual appliance?

    Cheers

    Thanks David,

    This is vCops 1.01 Enterprise.Â  The standard version doesn't support external adapters.

  content: Can you tell me if this will work with vCenter Operations Manager 5.6?
    Also will it work with Clariion CX4-960s? I will test it out and see but wanted
    to get some insight first :)

    with CX4, but it should if you are on a recent FLARE"

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I spent some time this week working on a demonstration of getting VNX block performance and configuration data into vCenter Operations for a customer.&nbsp; This scripts are very similar in function to the scripts that Clinton Kitson (fellow vSpecialist) wrote for the Hands On Labs at VMworld 2011 in Las Vegas.&nbsp; Mine are a little different in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>These scripts measure and report block performance only</li>
<li>These scripts pull in every metric that navicli can pull in</li>
<li>These scripts do *not* use Hyperic or any temporary files to post the data - its directly sucked in from memory</li>
<li>These are entirely in PowerShell</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some things to note about these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is no support for these.</strong>&nbsp; I will try to help you out if you have troubles, but these are NOT an official EMC product, just a demonstration of something cool.</li>
<li>These are currently alpha quality at best - <strong>you are on your own if you rely on them for anything important.</strong></li>
<li>The script supports only 1 array at a time.&nbsp; I intend to change that, but for now thats the deal.&nbsp; If you need to collect stats for more than 1 array, run the scripts multiple times.</li>
<li>Eventually these will be deprecated, whenever VMware comes out with a real adapter and not this hack :)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, instructions:</p>
<p>Install NaviCLI from PowerLink, and copy naviseccli.exe to the same directory you put this script.&nbsp; Ensure that statisics collection is enabled on your array.</p>
<p>Execute the with the following parameters:</p>
<pre>.vnxvcops.ps1 -username &lt;usernameforarray&gt; -password XXXXXX -scope 0 -spaip &lt;IP of SPA&gt; -spbip &lt;IP of SPB&gt; -interval &lt;Post interval in minutes&gt; -URL http://&lt;vcopsserverhostname&gt;/HttpPostAdapter/OpenAPIServlet</pre>
<p>When the script executes, it will display some progress information during the collection and posting process, and a quick output on every interval:</p>

9/29/2011 8:48:41 PM : Post Completed - Sleeping 5 minutes before next post</pre>
<p>What can you do in vCops with the data?&nbsp; How about this:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/vnxvcopsadapter/source/browse/trunk/vnxvcops.ps1">https://community.emc.com/thread/130486</a></p>
<p>To Do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Better error checking</li>
<li>LUN/Type Aggregations</li>
<li>Log to Event Log instead</li>
<li>Run as a service?</li>
<li>Support configuration file with multiple arrays</li>
<li>Support reporting on VNX File (NFS/CIFS) statistics</li>
<li>Other?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know if it works for you and other new features/bug fixes.</p>
