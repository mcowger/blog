title: A New Team for a New Application
comments: true
---

I posted earlier this year that I was changing roles - just within the first couple weeks its been a whirlwind internally letting people know, meeting with EMC leadership, getting silly technical issues fixed so I report the right way internally, etc.  But its also been fun - this is a brand new team, and with my colleagues, we get to shape it from the start.

Here's a quick description.

#So What Does My Team Do?

The team is responsible for evangelism, marketing and education of cloud native applications and the related technologies at EMC and, by extension, the Federation.  Our goals are to:

* create customer facing content for field teams to use in discussions.
* create and deliver education content focused on cloud native applications, modern application development (agile) and management (devops) alongside our friends in {code}, specifically focused on internal field teams, partners and customers.
* internally and externally evangelize EMC's efforts and solutions in this space to groups at executive briefings, industry events, meetups, hackathons

#Do You Have a Team Name (and where can I get a hoodie?)

UPDATE: Yes, we do.  We are the .next team, and I am working on hoodies :).

#So What Cool Stuff Do We Work On?

The team doesn't focus on any one technology and is not part of any specific business unit.  We focus on how EMC and the Federations offerings fit together into a cohesive set of technologies that can help our customers improve their agility and business. The tools and technologies we discuss most commonly include:

* Cloud Native Platforms / PaaS
  * VMware Photon
  * Cloud Foundry (OSS)
  * Pivotal Cloud Foundry
  * Apache Mesos & Marathon
  * Kubernetes
* Containers
  * Docker (+ Swarm & Compose)
  * Container Management (Mesos, Kubernetes, Photon, etc)
* DevOps & Agile
  * Complementary Products (Puppet, etc)
  * EMC & Pivotal Services
* Hardware & Appliances
  * VxRack
  * Neutrino and related upcoming projects
  * ECS
  * DSSD

#Do You Need Help?
 
Why yes, yes I do.  Right now my team is very small - just me and my good friend, fantastic presenter and awesome technologist [Tommy Trogden](https://twitter.com/vTexan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).  If the description below matches you, and you are in the New England (Boston, NYC, New Hampshire, New Jersey) area, please let me know and [apply here at the regular EMC site](https://jobs.brassring.com/tgwebhost/jobdetails.aspx?SID=%5ecveevQD6oZRDk7mRyru7mRUAS5uSbSrCflusRkMBL3kQvA9fSosfmKqgCLZ0RGx0&jobId=499179&type=search&JobReqLang=1&recordstart=1&JobSiteId=5116&JobSiteInfo=499179_5116&GQId=0).

Our cloud native applications marketing teams are looking to grow.  We need someone who knows the technology, and who can communicate it effectively.

If tools like Docker, Mesos, Cloud Foundry, Redis, etc are in your wheelhouse, that’s awesome.  If you can speak about them, even better.  If you can write blog posts and presentations, there’s another plus.

Building the messaging and value proposition for our set of solutions and key use cases/workloads and scenarios    

* Collaborating closely with Engineering, Product Management and Sales Leadership to define product positioning.  If you’ve ever said “this message would be better if…”, you’d be a great fit.
* Defining the differentiated positioning against key competitors and other solutions in this space
* Creation of rich sales and marketing content as well as ensuring consistency of messaging in content created by other stakeholders
* Being an speaker and representative at Key Events, Executive Briefings, Tradeshows
* Really like wearing hoodies.
* Participating in Analyst Briefings and engagements including analyst summits
* Participating in Press Briefings and engagements to promote the product through media channels
 
(principals only, blah blah blah)
