    Good post on an important topic for infrequent international travelers.

    I'm lazy (and was short on time) and last year I simply added the AT&amp;T international roaming plan that gave me what I recall as 250MB of data and "some" calling.  I believe the plan I upgraded to was about $30.  All said and done the trip cost me $40 added to my existing plan and canceled the international component for my next billing cycle.  Worked immediately upon landing and used WiFi quite a bit throughout the week.  My cellular usage wasn't extravagant nor miserly.  Just an FYI for readers AT&amp;T iPhones.

<p>Just a quick post this week (I have one coming next week about business relationships)...</p>
<p>Couple people have asked me what I'm doing for telecom in Barcelona for the VMworld show.  It has certainly been quite a few years since I was super into cell phone technology (at one point I went through like 4 phones a year!), so I had to do some research.  I knew I wanted to use my iPhone, and I wanted to use data over there, without paying the stupid fees that my carrier (Verizon) charges.</p>
<p>So first I had to do the research to figure out if</p>
<ol>
<li>my phone (a verizon iphone 5) uses the same frequencies as spain</li>
<li>my phone is gsm compatible</li>
<li>my phone is unlocked</li>
</ol>
<p>Some quick research showed me that all verizon iphone 5's are unlocked by verizon (what a surprise!), that the frequency bands are compatible for 3G data (no significant LTE in Europe, apparently) and that I can use it on GSM.  I can.  Sweet!<br />
Now I just needed to find a SIM that would work over there.  Now, a bunch of friends recommended just getting a PAYG SIM once I arrived, but my Spanish is rusty, and I'd like to be able to call my family as soon as I land without paying exorbitant fees.  Also, I'm a planner, so I wanted this out of the way.  Found a bunch of options, but I settled on <a href="http://www.holidayphone.com/payg-prepaid-sim-card-spain.html">HolidayPhone</a> for a couple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They provide a pre-cut SIM for my phone</li>
<li>They provide the SIM ahead of time and mail it to my house (from Sweden, no less!)</li>
<li>They provide a pretty good rate plan ($0.06/m to the US, and at least an hour of free incoming calls)</li>
<li>They have a clever call forwarding system so that I remain reachable on my US number, but also via Spanish phone number as well.</li>
<li>They have a good data plan (550MB for 30 days for about $7).</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like this combo will let me call my family as much as I like (and they can call me), call my colleagues and use Twitter/blogs/tethering etc as much I like (550MB is plenty for me given I will only be there for a week, and be limited to 3G performance).<br />
Worth a shot, at least, for a pretty cheap experiment of about $60</p>
<p>See everyone soon - I'm excited to see Barcelona for the first time.</p>
