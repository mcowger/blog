  content: "I don't disagree, seems like the problem has been that the type of person
    that has achieved VCDX to this point has made them very attractive. This be for
    their architecture, speaking and soft skills and that makes them a wanted product.\r\n\r\nSeems
    like the number of interested VCDX candidates is slowing increasing each year,
    not sure if the numbers are. Or if there are just more people interested. But
    I think VMware is heading in the right direction by trying to enable more people
    on their path to VCDX. The bootcamps, more defense opportunities and a book all
    help that were not there a year or so ago.\r\n\r\nBut I also agree there are probably
    more than a few partners that will have doubt will one of their staff starts to
    pursue VCDX."

  content: "I brought up point #1 from above a few weeks ago to be kicked around on
    Twitter.  Range of responses I got could be summarized into 2 categories:\r\n\r\n1)
    \ VCDXs are too talented for the type of roles partners/integrators/resellers/whatever
    have to offer.  Leads to job dissatisfaction or more attractive work/pay elsewhere.
    \ However, this would seem to contradict the approval process to fund the VCDX
    candidate's run.  The message received up front is \"we need VCDXs - go forth
    &amp; defend\".  Once certified the message is \"VCDXs are too smart to work for
    partners; the appropriate gigs are in Palo Alto\".  Personally, I don't buy this.
    \ Frankly it's dangerous for the ecosystem for the reasons you pointed out &amp;
    why I brought it up a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\n2)  Only the fittest survive.  If
    partners aren't paying enough or providing the type of role necessary to retain,
    that's their responsibility and that's on them.  I can neither confirm nor deny
    what VMware is offering in its VCDX tractor beam.  I'm very curious about their
    intent."

  content: "Matt - very interesting read.\r\n\r\nI won't begrudge anyone for taking
    advantage of a job opportunity, even if it's VMware. At best, I will only ever
    have 2nd hand information on any hires, and I'm sure there's a lot going on in
    back channels that I'm not aware of (nor do I care to be made aware of it). Keep
    in mind that targeting a VCDX hire is hiring more than just a cert - it also buys
    the experience, knowledge, and passion that go with it - typically a decade or
    more in quantity. In a \"I need it right now\" situation, there may not be enough
    time to grow your own. These people are apparently hard to find :)\r\n\r\nI will
    comment on the portion of your article that discusses the creation of newly minted
    VCDXs at VMware. One the one hand, I would agree that they do have every opportunity
    to be a design expert producing machine since a vast majority of in house content
    is available to them while only parts slip through into the Partner world. I would
    imagine that the top percentage of PSO folks get to work with and design around
    some incredibly complex and large scale workloads.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, being
    a VMware Partner (Consultant) grants one the ability to work in a variety of environments
    where the focus may not even be VMware - such as a core networking upgrade or
    large storage platform refresh tethered to an HP-UX. These sorts of encounters
    ultimately feed into a knowledge braintrust and can give a Partner a leg up on
    the design over someone who is always heads-down on VMware specific design."

  content: "TL;DR version - valid points, but I think you're wrong that VMware is
    \"poaching\".\r\n\r\nread on...\r\n\r\n\r\nYou bring up a lot of good points,
    Matt, as do Brian, Jason and Chris.  I'm going to  sprinkle in a bit from my own
    experience - my last day at a partner is tomorrow and my first day at VMware is
    next Monday.\r\n\r\nLet me start by saying that VMware did NOT recruit me - I
    sought out VMware.  I was dissatisfied with the amount of VMware-centered solutions
    I was able to architect at the partner I was working for.  My skills in core vSphere
    have faded due to lack of activity, which is exactly the opposite of what I expected
    when I moved from a customer to a partner.  I was hired for my experience (nobody
    really understood the certification IMO) but was rarely used for what I was hired
    for.  I did become somewhat of a more well-rounded data center architect (Cisco
    UCS + Nexus and EMC BRS and storage solutions), but at the expense of losing skills
    in VMware tech.  I personally wasn't comfortable with becoming rusty with something
    I had worked hard to achieve, so I started looking at other opportunities - both
    at other partners and at VMware.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview process for the position
    I was ultimately hired for, it became *VERY* clear that VMware has some rules
    against hiring from partners and treads very lightly when partners are involved.
    \ I was asked several pointed questions and I imagine that there were back-end
    conversations.  So I think that your assertion that VMware is actively targeting
    and poaching VCDXs from partners is false.  \r\n\r\nPersonally, my experience
    is a combination of both of Jason's points - and I think that I responded to his
    Twitter poll - if not in public then I tweeted a reply to him in my head ;)  The
    partner that I was at couldn't offer me what I ultimately wanted - and COMPLETELY
    UNDERSTOOD when I told them that I was leaving for VMware.  They didn't pay for
    my VCDX expenses, since I brought the certification to them (I certified while
    at a customer and, incidentally, paid for all of my expenses out of pocket).  Honestly,
    had they paid for my \"training\" then I don't know how I would have felt.  I
    probably would have \"given them their money's worth\", but that's just me.\r\n\r\nThere's
    a comic floating around where two guys are talking.  One says to the other \"what
    if we train our employees and they leave?\"  The other responds \"what if we don't
    train them and they stay?\"   It's a risk the partner has to be willing to take
    and an investment that they need to be willing to lose out on but try very, very
    hard to keep.   \r\n\r\nIn the end, I sought and found what I feel is just about
    the perfect job for me because I wasn't satisfied with what I was doing.  And
    it's at VMware, where I've wanted to work for a couple of years.  Perhaps, like
    me, many of the VCDXs who moved from partners to VMware felt the same way.\r\n\r\nI'm
    interested to hear experiences from others who have moved from a partner to VMware
    after VCDX achievement.  Did you seek out VMware as an employer or were you recruited?
    \ Respond anonymously if you have to - I just think that VMware is getting a reputation
    for recruiting from partners when in reality top talent is gravitating toward
    the Mother Ship."

  content: "I'll play devils advocate - i'm not sure if it's VMware going after the
    VCDX's as it might be more of VCDX's wanting to get the opportunity to work at
    VMware.  VCDX's are typically a pretty passionate, VMware focused individuals.
    \ In most cases, this drives them to wanting to work for the company they have
    a passion for.  We see this with Cisco, Microsoft etc.  I also thing the VCDX
    certification gives them (The VCDX) the leverage they need to overcome the hurdle
    of a VMware saying \"We can't hire from partners\".  VMware in this case feels
    the effort is worth the backlash from the partner in adding a VCDX to their team.
    \ Or  they (VMware) justify it with \"They were leaving that partner anyway, might
    as well try and keep him in the family\" that manufactures use to hire from partners/customers.
    \ \n\nI think VMware has to fight the urge to want to gobble them up because as
    you pointed out, it doesn't do them any good if Partners start shying away from
    their people getting these types of certifications.  \n\n@vTexan \nMCSE NT 4.0

    just because they hold the VCDX certification and work for a partner though.\r\n\r\nWhat
    if word got out that VMware wouldn't hire a VCDX?  That itself might limit the
    potential VCDX candidates - those, like myself, who have targeted VMware as a
    potential employer.  Maybe then I first get a job at VMware and only then do I
    submit for VCDX certification.  That does nobody any good.  At least now, I have
    challenged/helped one other person attempt and succeed at VCDX.  \r\n\r\nI think
    that it should be up to each individual partner to (1) accept the risk of paying
    for an individual to attempt/achieve VCDX and (2) be willing to challenge the
    individual and retain the talent that they \"paid\" for.  Some partners seem to
    be able to do this.  Ahead and Presidio come to mind.\r\n\r\nI think that we all
    want to \"matter\".  The VCDX that work for big or successful partners (or EMC
    or VMware) are challenged...those of us that work(ed) for smaller partners aren't."

    These are some very valid points.  While I'm concerned that VMware is 'poaching' VCDXs from the Partner space and sending the wrong message to the community, I don't think we should be banning VMware from hiring anyone.  Additionally, I (or anybody else) should be able to seek employment from any company I wish.  Nobody should be prevented from working where they want.  To paraphrase Volatire: "I disapprove of your choice, but I will defend to the death your right to choose it"
      Matt hits on the solution above: VMware should be actively promoting and supporting internal employees to achieve their VCDX.  There has been 14 new VCDXs added this year.  If the number doubled due to an influx of internal VCDX candidates, the hiring of 3 Partner VCDXs wouldn't be an issue.
       Why not encourage current employees in their pursuit?  When the prerequisites have been obtained and a candidate declares for their VCDX, grant them some time off for planning/design/preparation, sponsor him with a VCDX mentor, make it easy to get peer reviews, set up Mock defenses, and waive or reimburse any fees.  VMware should become an incubator for VCDX candidates.  With a program such as this in place, the PSO team would be flooded with people trying to get into the program.  The net result would be an exodus of VCDXs from VMware into the Partner community.
      It can be done with the right support model.  @ThinkAheadIT produced 3 VCDXs in less than a year by supporting their team.  Imagine what could be done if VMware did something similar.

    more content for VCDX and VCAP hopefuls."

    It's a very interesting discussion and is also one where if someone is so good at something then them eventually ending up being beamed up to the mother-ship is always a risk. But from my experience this is applicable for most certifications as companies will pay for you to do loads of training and exams and then in the end you leave and go to a better company offering you more money and better opportunities to use these new skills and learn more. BUT you do have to realise that VMware have also lost several VCDX to partner recently (Hugo Phan and Simon Long to name but two) who both did what you stated VMware should do of taking on someone, training them to VCDX level and then they left for a partner although they made this choice not VMware. I personally responded to Jason's tweet and stated there is definitely an under current of partners being nervous about paying for their employees to do their VCDX for the fear of them leaving.

    Also this isn't fully related to VCDX but EMC did the exact same thing for the vSpecialists but from the top 10-15 VMware bloggers list / vExperts of which if I'm not mistaken you were a product of this? Surely following this thought process partners must stop their employees becoming vExperts/blogging so that big companies don't poach them?

    Also for some people joining the mother-ship isn't the answer as you don't get to touch all the components like you do at a partner and the working with all these components is where people have become battle hardened for their respective VCDX's.

    Great article though and I think both sides make really good points.

  content: "As the VCDX Program Manager I have been following this discussion with
    great interest and now that many of you have spoken - I would like to add what
    I have observed and provide some clarity as to the goals of the VCDX Program.
    \n\nFirst an observation - I am always interested in who is going where (and why)
    because each one of you is an impact player in a very hot market. It amazes me
    that there isn't more volatility actually. I fact, if you look at the history
    of the program you will find that the number of VMware employee VCDX-holders who
    have left VMware to pursue opportunities with Partners (or to start a company
    and join the partner ecosystem) is equal to those who have left Partners to work
    for VMware. And, the total number of times the gate has swung in and out is quite
    low as is the frequency.\n\nNow some clarity on VCDX Program goals - My main foci
    for 2014 are to increase the number of VCDX-holders globally, to increase the
    number of VCDX-holders in the VMware Partner Network, and to continue to promote
    the VCDX brand in the market (VCDX is becoming a very hot brand!). You are the
    best SDDC solution design and delivery group in the world, period, everyone should
    know who you are and what you can do.\n\nLook for me at VMworld in Barcelona and
    at VMware Partner Exchange in San Francisco, email me or call me any time to discuss
    any aspect of the program. I am easy to find and always looking for your input."

    I too will share my recent experience on this subject...

    I interviewed with VMware for the position that Nate and one other person (also a VCDX) ultimately got (the better men got the jobs :)). I can also tell you that in addition to Nate it was me that sought out VMware, not the other way around.

    As far as I know VMware is not actively recruiting VCDX's, I believe in almost all cases it is the VCDX's that are going after VMware. The topic of me working for a partner came up during our discussions and it was definitely something they were concerned about, especially so because my organization did pay (like many other partner organizations do) for all of my VCDX related expenses. I was told that at the end of the day they were not going to turn me away from a career opportunity that I was seeking just because I work for a partner.

    I don't agree with the position that VMware should have a policy forbidding hiring partner VCDX's if it is the individual that seeks out employment there. I do agree that they shouldn't be actively recruiting or poaching folks from partners - that's wrong. I would have been pretty upset if VMware turned me away just because of where I worked.

    partner VCDX, and then joined VMware a few months later. My former company wasn't
    happy....) , I think the VCDX market is healthier than ever, and you can't or
    shouldn't ban any potential employer from hiring any potential employee. Free
    market forces should dictate. That being said, it is definitely not just one way
    as Mark mentioned, there are couple of recent VCDXs that left VMware for partners
    off to top of my head (Hugo Phan, Simon Long.. )

  content: "Great thread and wanted to add my 2 cents.\r\n\r\nFirst - Everyone should
    be allowed to find the job they want - period.  No interference, no rules, no
    hard feelings.  It's a job and it's the right of the person doing that job to
    seek out what's best for them (regardless of any certifications they hold).\r\n\r\nTo
    address workforce mobility...\r\n\r\nThe industry needs to better understand the
    type of person that attempts and/or achieves the VCDX certification.  This is
    a pretty unique individual with an excess of drive, passion, technical excellence,
    advanced communication skills, etc.  VCDX is not the only certification program
    that this type of person applies to.  To keep a person like that engaged, motivated
    and passionate they needs to be immersed into the proper role with great leadership.
    \ I challenge ALL employers equally (including mine) to look after their resources
    (and frequently it's not about money either).  Regardless of rules, industry or
    certification, people will move to ensure their own happiness.  There is nothing
    wrong with this.  Employers should be very familiar with this already and can
    chose to manage their employee relationships as they see fit.\r\n\r\nAnd don't
    forget...\r\n\r\nLet's not forget about all the other talent that moves this industry
    forward daily that are not stamped with a certification.  I suspect you'll see
    the same passion, job mobility and related issues.  It's easy to pick on a designation
    but I challenge everyone to look at talent at face value.\r\n\r\nI encourage everyone
    who is passionate about virtualization to apply to the VCDX program.  This industry
    continues to grow at an unprecedented rate and  every employer within this space
    needs your help.  This program is not just about certifying talent - it's about
    growing talent and becoming a better person by taking a challenge.  It carries
    a lot of industry responsibility so use it wisely."

    status.  Second - EMC, at the time, employed 2 VCDXs (Scott and Rick).  Not the
    ~45 that VMware currently employs - a very different number.\r\n\r\n2) vExpert
    doesn't cost an employer $10K for the employee to achieve.  Its non-continuous
    (e.g. has to be reearned every year).  Comparing vExpert to VCDX is comparing
    Peace Corp to the Marines."

<p>I have a growing concern about the future of the VCDX certification track.  Its certainly a vested interest; as a current VCDX, I want the certification to be hard to achieve, well marketed and valuable within the industry.  Why?  Because I like money, of course.</p>
<p>So my concern is this: <strong>it appears to me that VMware is aggressively hiring VCDXs</strong>, which I think is wrong, and dangerous to the future of the certification.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, VMware employs ~45 VCDXs</strong>, when I count through the VCDX page and apply some recent knowledge of moves.  In the past year, VMware has directly hired at least 4 VCDX from partners.  I believe there may be more.  I wont name them directly, because this article isn't about them (I applaud their personal choices), its about VMware.</p>
<p><strong>VMware should not be hiring VCDXs from partners.</strong>  In fact, I might go so far as to suggest VMware probably should avoid hiring existing VCDXs at all.  I believe this presents two dangers to the program itself.</p>
<ol>
<li>By draining the partner pool of VCDXs, VMware is effectively telling partners, "sure, go ahead and spend many thousands training this person up to VCDX level, paying for their hotels, defenses, etc - when you are done, we will go ahead, swoop in with a sweet offer you can't match and take them."  This is hardly the way to engender loyalty among partners.  <strong>The natural outgrowth of this tactic is that partners will no longer be interested in supporting the candidacy of a VCDX</strong>, simply because it wouldn't provide them any value.</li>
<li>The size of the VCDX pool is of crucial importance.  Too small, and customers either don't know about the certification (and therefore don't recognize the value a partner with the certification brings).  Too large, and it becomes nearly routine (think A+ certifications), and therefore of low value.  The pool needs to be large enough to be known, small enough to be a little rare, but again large enough so that there is a reasonable chance that a customer can find a partner with a VCDX or two (or <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkahead.com%2F&amp;ei=6jcuUpDzJMqpigLXyIGQDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwoUKm8Rd4iUWt_BlB4_gHvpifKA&amp;sig2=r736wqZ2wdlNKEmuQaMHzg&amp;bvm=bv.51773540,d.cGE">three</a>) on staff.  By hiring and employing so much of the VCDX pool (nearly 40%, by my count), VMware artificially limits the number of partners than will create or employ a VCDX, thus reducing the visibility and value of the certification itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of all the players (partners, VMware itself, vendors, people), the ones with the most opprtunity to fix this is VMware themselves.  With the VERY solid braintrust they have, existing large VCDX pool and the extensive resources and PSO-style options, VMware should be a VCDX-production <em>machine</em>.  It should be trivial (and a goal) for them to hire good people, train them up to VCDX level, get them certified internally and then (eventually, after a couple years paying their dues in PSO or what-have-you) going out into the partner community.  This have a number of effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The VCDX population grows to a larger size (which it needs to).</li>
<li>The partners are no longer afraid of supporting a VCDX candidacy</li>
<li>VMware gets all the VCDX power it needs</li>
</ul>
<p>This has some parallels to other top level certifications that some colleagues have brought up.  Specifically, they mentioned Cisco CCIE, and if I also believe that Cisco should not hire CCIEs.  I'd argue that, currently, given that there are thousands of CCIEs, that the pool size is no longer a problem, and that Cisco is in a different position.</p>
<p>With VMware out of the business of hiring partner VCDXs, partners &amp; vendors can go back to supporting VCDX candidates without fear and VMware can produce those that it needs internally.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
