  content: I wort at a zagg kiosk. The fogginess on the extreme shields is expected.
    It takes 2-4 days for any shield blemishes to completely evaporate.

  content: I'm not very happy with the shield either. It seems to be interfering with
    my keyboard. It's out of line when I type. I am wondering if the shield could
    be causing the problem.

  content: I bought the Extreme invisibleshield full body and mine looks like it has
    dark spots under against white background and the same spots are white looking
    against a dark background. I have used the other Zagg covers without issues, but
    I will give it a few days. I also noticed some keyboard issues at the edges. The
    back looked fine when I put it on last night, but today it looks like it has blobs
    of air under it.

  content: I just had the extreme Zagg put on my iPhone 5. Front, back and sides.
    After 2 days I have 2 black streaks on the back of the phone? Any suggestions?

  content: I installed the Zagg Extreme on my Galaxy S3 back in December, 2012. Still
    has a spot the size of a dimple that has not dried. Should dry in another week!
    Fortunately, this is a phone upgrade and I'm not in a big rush to activate and
    use my phone. I have used Zagg protectors on most of my portable electronics in
    the past, but this model is turning out to be a big disapointment because of the
    drying time. I did call up Zagg and they sent out a replacement with an improved
    version of the application fluid that should reduce the drying time, but I'm just
    going to stick it out and return the replacement before they charge me for it.

    Hi all!
    I've installed this shield back and front about a couple months ago, and this is to me the best iPhone 5 complete protection (screen and back concerned ;) )
    I've noticed the dark bubbles and everything that mentioned before, and these came off about 4 days to a whole week to perfectly be clear and fully usable - this comleteley worth the wait!
    Many people asked me which protection this is, also an employee of the Genius Bar bought one, was absolutely excited to know that this exists.
    I've tried many covers, bumpers, and protection films and stops to this spot. The best one,
    absolutely protective and clear that looks also like a glass feeling, which is very close to an iPhone 4, and added a little thickness that is fine to whoever find the iPhone 5 too thin.
    Ps : I have to warn : I've installed an addition cover to just try with the shield for 1 day,
    Result : the shield just popped up on a 0.5mm once case removed, looks not really bad but the popped part looked like 'bubbled' part in.
    I have the Extreme classic (so not the case-friendly, which is why the case gets in contact with the classic that covers the whole phone part) and Do Not to fit a case anyway even to try like i did, or choose the Case-friendly. ;)
    I have now the choice to keep it, or give back to zagg for a free replacement.

<p>I bought the Zagg invisible shield extreme for my iPhone 5. It's the one they sell that they claim is protection for the iPhone from even breakage, even though it appears to be less than a half mil thick. There's a very convincing video up on their website about it.</p>
<div></div>
<div>So, when my phone and the shield arrived at the same time today, I was pretty psyched. I installed it mere seconds after the phone was out of the case.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Installation:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Installation of the shield was very simple. I have experience installing large scale decals, so the process of wetting the shield, placing it and squeegee removal of extra liquid was pretty simple.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Good:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>It's pretty thin - I suspect you could use almost any case with it.</li>
<li>It didn't seem to scratch easily, even when placed face down on my garage floor.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>The Bad:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect something called a shield to protect only the front glass. I expected it to protect the back and possible sides as well. It doesn't.</li>
<li>The shield does not fit the front of the phone well at all-it only covers maybe 95% of the front, leaving about 1-2mm around all edges unprotected.  (see note below).</li>
<li>After only a few minutes, I could see that it gave a slight yellow cast to the display, not unlike early reports from the iPhone 4.</li>
<li>After few hours, it developed some lack of clarity (not due to finger prints). <a href="http://www.exaforge.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/image.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://www.exaforge.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/image.jpg?w=487" alt="Image" /></a></li>
</ul>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>While it seems like a great idea, I can't recommend this, especially at $30. I can get a properly protective TPU case for that money. I will be looking at how to return this.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Update: Sept 24: True to their word, Zagg quickly offered up a refund under their 45 day guarentee, which is pretty sweet.  Also, the representative informed me that they have a new version of the shield available that isn't 'Case Friendly' that covers the *entire* front panel.</div>
