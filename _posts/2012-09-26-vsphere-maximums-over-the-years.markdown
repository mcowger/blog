<p>I saw Eric Siebert's great research article today on the ESX maximums over the years and how they've changed.  You can <a href="http://vsphere-land.com/news/vmware-configuration-maximums-from-10-to-51.html">find his article here. </a></p>
<p>I was curious what this data looked like graphically, so I threw it in Excel and gave it a shot.  All credit should go to Eric for doing the real work here, but still interesting to see.</p>
<p>First, all the data together:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.exaforge.com/images/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-26-at-4-43-17-pm.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-269" title="Screen Shot 2012-09-26 at 4.43.17 PM" src="http://www.exaforge.com/images/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-26-at-4-43-17-pm.png" alt="" width="640" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>But then I realized that the large values (like 2TB = 2048 GB) were hiding some of the other changes (like pNics) due to scale, so I broke things out a bit - click through the slide show here:</p>

<p>I'm most impressed by the changes in vRAM, personally.</p>
