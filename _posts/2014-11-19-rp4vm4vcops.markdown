<p>Now that <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2014/11/scaled-up-vm-level-protection-now-ga.html">RecoverPoint for VMs is fully out and ready to go</a> (check out <a href="http://itzikr.wordpress.com">Itzik's</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ62QJJuF_s"> awesome demo</a>), I wanted to share something fun and interesting.</p>
<p>Building vRealize Ops (neé vC Ops) adapters for random stuff (in a totally unsupported fashion, of course) is a well known hobby of mine, and RP4VMs is no different.  With a huge amount of help from Zahid Fadli (one of the RecoverPoint Corporate SEs), I managed to get RecoverPoint for VMs to push data into vR Operations.</p>
<p>As usual, <a href="https://github.com/mcowger/vcopsrp4vm">its on my github</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
