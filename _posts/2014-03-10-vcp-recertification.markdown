<p>VMware announced recently that they would <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=46667&amp;ui=www_cert">start requiring re-certification of VCPs</a>.  I'm not sure I feel like this is a good call.</p>
<p>Their reasoning is two fold (as far as I can tell):</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring that VCP holder's knowledge is current.  "<em>But staying up to date in the expertise gained and proven by your certification is equally vital. If your skills are not current, your certification loses value."</em></li>
<li>Most other industry certifications require this as well. <em>"...and is on par with other technical certifications like ones offered by HP, Cisco and CompTia (A+)"</em> <a href="http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmware-certified-professional-recertification/">-- Christian Mohn</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I think both of these arguments are specious.</p>
<ol>
<li>VCPs are tied to a specific version of vSphere...they aren't 'version agnostic'.  Check out my transcript below:<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-10-at-10.38.33-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-474" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-10 at 10.38.33 AM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-10-at-10.38.33-AM-1024x451.png" width="584" height="257" /></a>Every certification I've received is version specific.  Meaning there's nothing to 'keep up to date'.  vSphere 3.5 hasn't changed.  Therefore my VCP3 shouldn't need to be updated.  Clearly, if I don't hold VCP4 or VCP5 (or some other, higher certification), I can't show that I've been keeping up with the technology, and that my knowledge of the <strong>current </strong>product line is outdated, but that doesn't impact the understanding in my VCP3.  There's no reason to remove my ability to use the VCP3 logo...and perhaps VMware should drop the use of unversioned logos:<br />
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/03/VCP_Logo.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-475" alt="VCP_Logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/03/VCP_Logo.gif" width="300" height="240" /></a>in favor of versioned logos like this:</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/03/vcp5_image_400X300.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-476" alt="vcp5_image_400X300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/03/vcp5_image_400X300-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>So that its more clear how current a given person's certification is.</li>
<li>Other vendors do expire certifications, but the majority of vendors also don't specify a version number on the certification itself.  The CCNA, CCIE, from everything I understand are non-version specific, and therefore having to 'recertify' is entirely reasonable, because the technology they refer to has changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it - I think the re-certification requirement is silly.</p>
