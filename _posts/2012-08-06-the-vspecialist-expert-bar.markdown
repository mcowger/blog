<p>I'm pleased to be able to discuss a project that I've been trying to bring to life for almost 4 months now: the VMworld 2012 vSpecialist Expert Bar!  <a href="https://www.skedge.me/emcexpertlounge">(Quick link to scheduling!</a>)</p>
<p>The last few VMware &amp; EMC conferences I've been to I've been approached by customers and partners (and even some partial competitors!) asking if there was a way for them to just quickly/easily schedule a short period to just ask quick random questions without needing a full on trip with a sales guy, etc.</p>
<p>So, I'm happy to announce that with a bunch of work, and a lot of help from the EMC vSpecialist management team (thanks to<a href="http://www.twitter.com/vcemonster"> Jeff Thomas</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/nixfred">Fred Nix</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/wadeoharrow">Wade O'Harrow</a>) and the EMC marketing team, we will have the vSpecialist Expert Bar open for business the entire time the floor show is open.</p>
<p>We'll have people that are experts in VDI, vC Ops, VNX, Symmetrix, vCloud Director, SRM (RecoverPOint and SRDF).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.exaforge.com/images/2012/08/screen-shot-2012-08-06-at-10-36-19-am.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-244" title="Screen Shot 2012-08-06 at 10.36.19 AM" src="http://www.exaforge.com/images/2012/08/screen-shot-2012-08-06-at-10-36-19-am.png" alt="" width="114" height="145" /></a></p>
<p>We'll have a table with built-in whiteboard, 2 people taking questions and maybe some schwag to give away :).</p>
<p>But wait - there's MORE!</p>
<p>We'll also be allowing you to schedule a 20 minute block ahead of time, so you can make it work with your schedule.  We'll also have walk-up availability when there are no appointments or cancellations/no-shows.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please be nice and don't just sign up all the slots</li>
<li>Think about what you'd like to discuss during your appointment.</li>
<li>We can't guarantee which vSpecialist you'll talk to - sorry!</li>
</ol>
